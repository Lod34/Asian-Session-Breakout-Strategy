# Asian Session Breakout Strategy - Forex Trading

## Overview

This strategy is designed for trading **forex** by analyzing price movements from a **macro** perspective on higher timeframes (1D or 15-minute charts), while focusing on **trend changes** at lower timeframes (M5 and M1, with a stronger emphasis on M1). The goal is to identify trend reversals after the price breaks out of the Asian session range and execute trades based on market structure changes.

## Key Strategy Components

1. **Asian Session High and Low**:
   - The strategy calculates the **high** and **low** of the **Asian session** (00:00 - 06:00 UTC). These levels act as key support and resistance zones for the upcoming session.
   
2. **Price Breakout After 8:00**:
   - After **8:00** UTC, the strategy monitors whether the price breaks out **above the high** or **below the low** of the Asian session. A valid breakout after this time indicates a potential trading opportunity.

3. **Structural Change**:
   - Once a breakout occurs, the strategy waits for a **change in market structure**:
     - If the price breaks the **Asian session low**, the market structure must shift from **bearish** to **bullish**.
     - If the price breaks the **Asian session high**, the market structure must shift from **bullish** to **bearish**.
   
4. **Entry on Retracement**:
   - A trade is executed on a **retracement** after the structural shift:
     - The entry can be at **market price** or set at **limit/stop orders** around previous **support/resistance** levels.
     - **Stop Loss** is placed at the minimum/maximum level that supports the new trend.
     - **Take Profit** is set at:
       - The **Asian session high** if the price broke the **Asian low**.
       - The **Asian session low** if the price broke the **Asian high**.

## Trade Setup Summary
